# Project Setup and Execution

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Step 1: Open the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

### Step 2: Start the Server

Open one terminal window and ensure you are in the project directory. To start the server, run the following command:
#### node main.js

### Step 3: Start the Client Side

Open another terminal window in the same project directory. To run the client side, execute the following command:
### dotnet run

### Step 4: Generate 'sortedPackets.json' File

After running the client side, the 'sortedPackets.json' file will be generated. This file contains the sorted packet data.

By following these steps, you'll have the server and client side of the project up and running, and you'll generate the required 'sortedPackets.json' file.
